4 kinds of start:
start and then keep going (disable until next start interrupt) -- power
start then stop -- 1 frame
start then repeat (loop)
start then disable until next enabling_start (while still valid) -- multi frame

Power mode: keep running with same inputs until interrupt
Multi-frame mode: load I n clks -> send, load new I; pause after send through & while sending, store output on valid
-- need to pull out valid and maybe k? -- no reset.

IFFT (in normalize)

Mem read enable -- add in?
