ifft (in normalize)

// enable should be synced

check fft ports



  // 3 multiplies
  // mem readen, test 100? 7*7 whats up with combo, 3780
  // turn off valid -- check enable randomly turn off -- how affects? (maybe just bad output? but internally ok?) -- on all dspmodule pipes; check any regs in ctrl??? -- on reset, what happens w/ pipe? all pipe elems should be 0'ed?: does it affect din?

print + save + compare w/ full list @ end dout

loop

4 kinds of start: 
start and then keep going (disable until next start)
start then stop
start then repeat (loop)
start then disable until next enabling_start (while still valid)



 Start frame = run for n clocks. Keep storing k , valid out, data out. After n clocks stop. Read out output. Input new data. Different input but without reset command (after original, pause). Read out again. Repeat. Check when valid. Increment frame after k = fft size-1. Repeat.

// enable pass through for continuous cycle to avoid read/write conflict?

setup.en, reset --> resets chain of outvalid pipes
k should eventually get reset?

io en goes low --> needs to update valid



check k transitions at right time -- even with enable delay
