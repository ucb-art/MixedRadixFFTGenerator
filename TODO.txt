test that outvalid goes low on new setup


// rewrite tester







Load setup reg write to start setup reg. Prob for setup done (stay high) write to data in mem. Start frame = run for n clocks. Keep storing k , valid out, data out. After n clocks stop. Read out output. Input new data. Different input but without reset command (after original, pause). Read out again. Repeat. Check when valid. Increment frame after k = fft size-1. Repeat.
