check delays match with paper (from when i wasraddr=waddr checking)

  // overall setup done on right clk cycle + using counter (matches IOen) -- hold setupdone
  // * memBanks (mem needs enable)
  // fix frameout timing - k, valid delay needs changing
  // 3 multiplies
  // mem readen, test 100?, 3780
  // w0z
  // tilelink
  // check enable
  // pass out slow enable

mode for running same data through many times for power







Load setup reg write to start setup reg. Prob for setup done (stay high) write to data in mem. Start frame = run for n clocks. Keep storing k , valid out, data out. After n clocks stop. Read out output. Input new data. Different input but without reset command (after original, pause). Read out again. Repeat. Check when valid. Increment frame after k = fft size-1. Repeat.

-- another mode where it's one at a time
